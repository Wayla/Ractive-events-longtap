===========================

A `longtap` event is fired after an element has been held for more than 0.5 seconds.

*Find more Ractive.js plugins at [ractivejs.org/plugins](http://ractivejs.org/plugins)*

Usage
-----

Include this file on your page below Ractive, e.g:

```html
<script src='lib/Ractive.js'></script>
<script src='lib/Ractive-events-longtap.js'></script>
```

Or, if you're using a module loader, require this module:

```js
// requiring the plugin will 'activate' it - no need to use the return value
require( 'Ractive-events-longtap' );
```
